**NFR-10.2.2: Data Residency**
- Data must be stored in specified geographic regions
- Cross-border data transfer must comply with regulations
- Data residency must be configurable per tenant
- Data location must be auditable

## 11. Environmental & Sustainability

### 11.1 Energy Efficiency

**NFR-11.1.1: Power Consumption**
- Idle resource utilization must be minimized
- Auto-scaling must reduce resources during low usage
- Energy-efficient algorithms must be preferred
- Carbon footprint must be monitored and reported

**NFR-11.1.2: Resource Optimization**
- Over-provisioning must be minimized
- Unused resources must be automatically reclaimed
- Storage must be compressed where appropriate
- Network traffic must be optimized

## Requirement Validation

### Verification Methods

Each non-functional requirement must be verified through:

| Category | Verification Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| Performance | Load testing, benchmarking, profiling |
| Availability | Uptime monitoring, failover testing |
| Scalability | Stress testing, capacity testing |
| Security | Penetration testing, security audits |
| Usability | User testing, feedback collection |
| Maintainability | Code reviews, static analysis |
| Disaster Recovery | DR drills, backup restoration tests |

### Monitoring & Reporting

- All NFRs must have associated metrics
- Metrics must be tracked continuously
- NFR violations must trigger alerts
- NFR compliance must be reported monthly
- Trend analysis must identify degradation

## Prioritization

| Priority | Description | Requirements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | Must meet for production launch | Performance (API, message), Availability (99.9%), Security (encryption, auth), Data durability |
| **P1 - High** | Must meet within 3 months | Scalability (horizontal), DR (RTO/RPO), Compliance (GDPR/CCPA) |
| **P2 - Medium** | Must meet within 6 months | Advanced monitoring, Capacity planning, SOC2/ISO compliance |
| **P3 - Low** | Nice to have | Localization, Advanced analytics, Environmental metrics |

## Acceptance Criteria

An NFR is considered met when:
1. **Measured**: Metrics exist to measure the requirement
2. **Verified**: Testing confirms the requirement is met
3. **Sustained**: Requirement is consistently met over 30 days
4. **Documented**: Evidence is documented and reviewed
5. **Monitored**: Ongoing monitoring alerts on violations
